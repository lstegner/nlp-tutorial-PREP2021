    "## Quick Review\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is NLP?\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be broadly thought of as the computational tools used to help computers understand and manipulate spoken or written natural language to do useful things. This goal can be achieved with the help of various NLP tasks, such as:\n",
    " * Part of speech tagging\n",
    " * Speech recognition\n",
    " * Word sense disambiguation\n",
    " * Sentiment analysis\n",
    " * Natural langauge generation\n",
    " * Named entity recognition\n",
    " * Co-reference resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the above tasks is briefly described in [this article](http://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/natural-language-processing) by IBM. \n",
    "\n",
    "Practically, NLP is present in our everyday lives. Some common examples include autocorrect, autocomplete, *related search* terms in a web engine, email filtering, smart agents (e.g. Siri or Alexa), and machine translation (e.g. Google Translate). It is also useful in business applications such as to analyze reviews or to create automated calling systems and chat bot assistants.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Did you have any questions about this basic understanding of NLP or high-level questions about the different NLP tasks?*\n",
    "\n",
    "### What will we use NLP for?\n",
    "While NLP is being readily implemented in everyday products, it is also greatly useful in data science. NLP can be used to convert messy, unstructured natural language responses (such as interview data or open responses to survey questions) into more structured, processable data forms. Using NLP techniques to analyze data can serve to speed up processing time and also eliminate inconsistencies from manual analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where does data for NLP come from?\n",
    "Business will often use reviews or survey responses to extract information about how their business is doing. Recorded phone calls with customer service agents are also used for NLP training purposes--that's the \"this call may be recorded for quality assurance purposes\" messsage on many customer service calls! It is also common to get data from social media, such as through the [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs) or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/api).\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers may use either datasets attained from the web, including social media or messaging logs, or from their own work, such as transcribed interviews, open-ended survey responses, or other data collection that results in natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "Pop quiz: *In your own words, what is sentiment analysis?*\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we perform sentiment analysis?\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is ultimately performed with a machine learning classifier. Today, we will be using a supervised learning technique called Naive Bayes. You can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2L2Uv9pdDA) for an introduction to it if you are curious. The algorithm itself is already provided by the `nltk` library we will be using. In fact, most of the work needs to be done to preprocess the text into the proper format; the actual classifier is simple to build and use with `nltk`."

We will use examples of positive and negative tweets to train our model, then use that model to classify unknown tweets from a different dataset."
